These are what I wrote for the opensidewalks project at the University of Washington. 

Sidewalk_Issues_Encountered_from_Single_Given_Coordinate_Seattle.ipynb is the main file that I worked on. It generates a graph that shows how accessible a place is, utilizing the accessmap.io api. It produces a graph where the regions that have colors closer to blue/purple are more accessible than the regions with red/orange. 

SidewalkObservations.ipynb and SidewalkVarifications.ipynb graph out the preliminary datasets that we have. These are for practicing only. 

My code need to run with the dataset provided by the seattle government. See the link below or the documentation in code (need the 5 shp files in the same folder).
